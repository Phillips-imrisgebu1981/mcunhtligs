Just walked out of the theater after watching The Legend of Ochi, and let me tell ya, I'm swimming—or maybe drowning?—in all sorts of feels right now. Still smell the popcorn butter on my fingers, but honestly, who cares, because what is this film even?? Is it okay for a film to leave you tired and wired at the same time? Felt like I ran a marathon with a blindfold on. 

So there’s this mystical forest, right, and I swear it felt alive... or maybe it was just that sticky floor in the theater giving me the creeps. There's this girl, Leia, who starts chatting with these weird, magical creatures called the Ochi. First thought: Did I miss a memo when imaginary friends became mystical animals that change the destiny of forests? Makes my childhood feel seriously underwhelming. 

> And the visuals! Like someone painted a dream but forgot to let it dry. Found myself staring at the screen thinking, “Well, that's what happens when unicorns and fever dreams have a baby, I guess.” The colors were punch-you-in-the-face bright and like, do these exist outside the director’s imagination, or should we be worried? For real, I'd buy a ticket just for the art and call it a day.

But can we talk about Leon for a sec? That guy looked like he was constantly regretting life decisions and his hair had a mind of its own. I mean, can we start a GoFundMe to find that guy a decent conditioner? Sarcasm aside, he totally sold this air of tragic mystery, which I'm not sure if that's what his character needed or they just forgot to write him happy moments. Story of my life.

Feels like the movie was whispering secrets they're daring you to figure out, and honestly, I was too busy trying to be an Ochi to care. Somebody tell the movie that not everyone came here to solve puzzles, okay?

Plus, the soundtrack had me floating somewhere between middle-earth and a caffeine high. Props to whoever decided on that combo. I'd say more, but I can’t recall much except how it felt like being hugged by a galactic octopus. Is that a good thing? I don't know anymore. My brain’s a bit scrambled, in case you can't tell.

So yeah, would I recommend downloading the movie? Sure, if you ever wanted a film to paint your emotions in chaotic brushstrokes. Watch the movie, maybe, if you're ready for an art exhibit disguised as a storyline. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to google how to find your inner Ochi because apparently, that's a thing in my life now. Cheers to confusion on a cosmic level!
